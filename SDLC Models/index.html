            <button class="accordion">Waterfall</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>The waterfall model is a breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks. The approach is typical for certain areas of engineering design. In software development, it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction ("downwards" like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment and maintenance.

            <button class="accordion">Iterative</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Iteration is the repetition of a process in order to generate a (possibly unbounded) sequence of outcomes. Each repetition of the process is a single iteration, and the outcome of each iteration is then the starting point of the next iteration.
                 In mathematics and computer science, iteration (along with the related technique of recursion) is a standard element of algorithms.

            <button class="accordion">Prototyping</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p> Prototyping is an experimental process where design teams implement ideas into tangible forms from paper to digital. Teams build prototypes of varying degrees of fidelity to capture design concepts and test on users. With prototypes, you can refine and validate your designs so your brand can release the right products.

            <button class="accordion">Spiral</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>The spiral model is a risk-driven software development process model. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such as incremental, waterfall, or evolutionary prototyping.

            <button class="accordion">V-shape</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>In software development, the V-model[2] represents a development process that may be considered an extension of the waterfall model, and is an example of the more general V-model. Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing. The horizontal and vertical axes represent time or project completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain abstraction uppermost), respectively.

              <button class="accordion">Agile</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. ... Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.
